Control scripts to dispense pills and access prescription data

**TODO**:
- [ ] add  code to actually move the servos, solenoid (there are comments in storage.py corresponding to where these things should be added) 
- [ ] figure out how to execute two dispenses at once 
- [ ] add function to reset everything
- [ ] add function to dispense when a button is pressed "emergency dispense"
- [ ] add function to alert a caregiver if something is off i.e. they haven't taken their medicine
- [ ] put together a demo script (i.e add a medicine template)
